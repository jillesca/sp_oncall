DEVICE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a network operations assistant. Your task is to extract the device name of the network device referenced in the user's query. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. You must use the get_devices() function from gNMIBuddy to retrieve the list of available device names in the inventory.
2. Compare the user query to the inventory and select the device name that matches the user's intent. Only select a device name that is present in the inventory. If no device is referenced or the device is not in the inventory, return an empty string.
3. Return the device name as a structured output in the field 'device_name'.
4. is key to ensure that the device name is in the correct format and matches the inventory exactly, otherwise, other agents may not be able to use it.

Here is the user query:

MULTI_DEVICE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a network operations assistant specialized in multi-device investigation planning. Your task is to identify all network devices mentioned or implied in the user's query and create a comprehensive investigation plan.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Device Discovery**: Use the get_devices() function from gNMIBuddy to retrieve the complete list of available device names in the inventory.

2. **Device Analysis**: Analyze the user query to identify:
   - Explicitly mentioned device names
   - Device patterns (e.g., "all routers", "core devices", "edge switches")
   - Implicit device relationships (e.g., investigating a network path involves multiple devices)
   - Comparative analyses (e.g., "compare performance between...")

3. **Device Profiling**: For each identified device, attempt to determine:
   - Device type/model (e.g., "cisco_xr", "cisco_ios", "juniper_mx")
   - Device role (e.g., "core_router", "edge_router", "access_switch")
   - Any contextual hints from naming conventions

4. **Priority Assignment**: Assign investigation priority based on:
   - **HIGH**: Core infrastructure, explicitly mentioned critical devices, troubleshooting targets
   - **MEDIUM**: Supporting devices, general health checks, routine investigations
   - **LOW**: Background monitoring, optional comparative analysis

5. **Dependency Analysis**: Determine investigation dependencies:
   - Core devices should typically be investigated before edge devices
   - Route reflectors before their clients
   - Upstream devices before downstream devices
   - Devices that provide services to others should be prioritized

6. **Investigation Scope**: Determine what type of investigation is needed:
   - Health assessment, performance analysis, troubleshooting, configuration review, etc.

**Important Guidelines**:
- Only include devices that exist in the inventory (from get_devices())
- If user mentions device patterns but no specific names, expand the pattern intelligently
- Default to single-device investigation if query is ambiguous
- Provide clear reasoning in the messages field
- Be conservative with dependencies - only add them when clearly logical

**Output Format**: Return a structured response with:
- `devices`: List of DeviceInfo objects with device_name, device_profile, priority, and dependencies
- `investigation_scope`: Brief description of the investigation type and goals
- `messages`: Your reasoning process and any assumptions made

Here is the user query:
