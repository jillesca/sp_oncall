  "description": "Checks the operational status, statistics, and error counters for network interfaces. Can be used for all interfaces or a specific interface if mentioned by the user.",
  "steps": [
    "Retrieve a summary of all interfaces, noting their administrative and operational statuses. Identify any interfaces that are administratively up but operationally down, or unexpectedly down.",
    "For any specific interface mentioned in the user query, or for interfaces showing issues, obtain detailed statistics including traffic rates (input/output), packet counts, and error counts (e.g., CRC errors, input errors, output drops).",
    "Analyze error counters. A small number of errors might be normal over a long period, but rapidly incrementing errors or specific types of errors (like CRCs, giants, runts) indicate physical layer or SFP issues. Output drops might indicate congestion.",
    "Check the interface description and connected endpoint information (if available via LLDP/CDP) to understand its role and connectivity.",
    "If an interface is down, investigate logs for messages related to that interface for clues about why it went down (e.g., link flap, SFP issue, configuration change)."
