  "description": "Performs a standard review of a Route Reflector (RR), focusing on BGP session health with clients and overall BGP stability.",
  "steps": [
    "Perform a general device health check: CPU, memory, hardware status, logs for critical errors related to BGP, and uptime. High CPU on an RR can impact BGP convergence.",
    "List all BGP clients (PEs, other RRs) and verify their session state. All clients should be in 'Established' state. Investigate any down or flapping clients.",
    "Check BGP session uptime for all clients. Frequent resets for any client indicate instability.",
    "Monitor the total number of BGP prefixes (IPv4, IPv6, VPNv4, etc.) being handled by the RR. Note any sudden significant changes. Ensure it's within capacity limits.",
    "Verify the number of prefixes received from and advertised to key clients or client groups. Ensure this is consistent with the network design and policy.",
    "Check BGP cluster ID and other RR-specific configurations for correctness.",
    "Review BGP memory usage and RIB/FIB table sizes. Ensure there's no excessive resource consumption.",
    "Check for any BGP error messages, especially related to session establishment, update processing, or path selection."
