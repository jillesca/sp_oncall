  "description": "Performs a standard review of a Provider Edge (PE) device, focusing on customer-facing services and core connectivity.",
  "steps": [
    "Perform a general device health check: CPU, memory, hardware status, logs for critical errors, and uptime.",
    "Check the status of all core-facing interfaces (links to P routers). Verify they are up, error-free, and appropriately utilized. Note any high utilization or errors.",
    "Verify BGP sessions with Route Reflectors (RRs) and other PEs. Ensure sessions are established and prefix counts are nominal.",
    "Review status of customer-facing interfaces. Note any down interfaces or interfaces with significant errors or discards. Investigate any anomalies.",
    "Check VRF (VPN Routing and Forwarding) instance status. For key VRFs, verify route targets, route distinguishers, and interfaces associated.",
    "Examine MPLS LDP or Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) adjacencies and forwarding state towards the core. Ensure adjacencies are up and label forwarding tables are consistent.",
    "Briefly review any configured QoS policies on customer interfaces to ensure they are applied and check for drops in critical queues.",
    "Check for any alarms specific to PE functionality (e.g., VPLS, L3VPN service alarms)."
