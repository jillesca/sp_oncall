    "Check overall device CPU and memory utilization. Investigate any components with excessively high or sustained usage, as this could indicate performance bottlenecks or an overloaded device.",
    "Verify the operational status and health of all critical hardware components, such as line cards, power supplies, and fan trays. Note any alarms or abnormal statuses.",
    "Review system logs for any recent critical or error-level messages. Pay attention to patterns or recurring issues that might indicate underlying problems.",
    "Check the system uptime to understand if there have been any recent unexpected reboots.",
    "Verify the current software version and compare against recommended stable versions if known, noting any pending critical patches or known vulnerabilities associated with the current version."
