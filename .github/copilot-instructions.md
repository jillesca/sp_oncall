These are rules you must always follow:

- You must never commit any files. I used the staging directory to prepare changes before committing. If you commit a change, you mess with my workflow.
- You must never push any commits to any remote branches. I use commits to review changes before they are merged.
- You must never merge a PR. I use PRs to review changes before they are merged.
