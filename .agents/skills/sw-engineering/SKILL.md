# Software Engineering Standards

## Core Principles

Apply all of the following to every code change:

- **DRY** — Centralise shared logic; do not duplicate it across modules
- **KISS** — Choose the simplest solution that satisfies the requirement
- **YAGNI** — Implement only what is needed now; do not add speculative features
- **SOLID** — Follow Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
- **Modularity** — Encapsulate distinct concerns in separate modules so each is independently testable
- **Zen of Python** — Favour simplicity, readability, and explicitness (`import this`)

## Readability and Structure

Code must read like a book — a reader should be able to follow the flow top to bottom without jumping around:

- Use clear, descriptive names for every symbol; abbreviations are not acceptable
- Place public/external functions at the top of a module
- Place helper functions used by a public function directly below it
- Place internal/private functions after the helpers
- Comments explain **why** something is done, never **what** — the code itself must be self-explanatory
- Follow Martin Fowler's refactoring principles: write code that humans understand easily

## Object Design and Boilerplate Avoidance

Using dictionaries to encapsulate related data or behaviour **is prohibited** — use objects instead.

Before creating any new class or abstraction, ask:

1. Does this object add genuine value, or is it duplicating an existing data structure?
2. Am I solving a real problem, or adding complexity for the sake of design purity?
3. Can I work directly with an existing immutable object (e.g. a dataclass)?
4. Am I copying fields between objects with no transformation? If so, work directly with the source.

**Critical balance**: readability for humans is the most important quality and must never be sacrificed for theoretical purity. A simple, direct approach that reads well beats a "properly architected" complex solution.

Guidelines:

- Favour composition over unnecessary abstraction
- Eliminate attribute duplication — never mirror an existing structure with different names
- Remove intermediate objects that exist only to pass data from one point to another
- Prefer clarity over architectural purity

## Notes

- For logging, follow the existing framework in `src/logging` — do not introduce new logging libraries or patterns
