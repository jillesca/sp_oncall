# üöÄ SP Oncall: Automated Network Diagnostics with LangGraph

SP Oncall is an intelligent agent-based system for automating network device diagnostics and health checks. It leverages [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) to orchestrate a graph of specialized agents, each responsible for planning, executing, assessing, and reporting on network troubleshooting tasks. The system uses [gNMIBuddy](https://github.com/jillesca/gNMIBuddy) via the MCP protocol to extract real-time data from network devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)
- Access to OpenAI or compatible LLM API
- [gNMIBuddy](https://github.com/jillesca/gNMIBuddy) (for MCP tool integration)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

1. **Set up environment variables** (required for LLM and tracing):

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```bash
   # .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
   LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-key
   LANGSMITH_PROJECT=your-project-name
   ```

   The system will automatically load these variables at runtime. Using a `.env` file is required for correct operation with LangGraph.

2. **Run the agent system**

```bash
make run
```

This will install all dependencies and start the LangGraph workflow.

## üîå MCP Tool Configuration

SP Oncall uses gNMIBuddy as its main tool for extracting data from network devices. Make sure to configure the MCP client in your environment. Example configuration (see `README.md` for details):

```json
{
  "gNMIBuddy": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "mcp[cli],pygnmi,networkx",
      "mcp",
      "run",
      "/absolute/path/to/gNMIBuddy/mcp_server.py"
    ],
    "transport": "stdio",
    "env": {
      "NETWORK_INVENTORY": "/absolute/path/to/gNMIBuddy/xrd_inventory.json"
    }
  }
}
```
